I leverage `Intl` to build consistent multilingual experiences, such as formatting currency values (e.g., `Intl.NumberFormat`), dates (e.g., `Intl.DateTimeFormat`), and locale-sensitive string comparisons (e.g., `Intl.Collator`). In this application, `Intl` could complement the manual translation system, ensuring dynamic elements like dates or prices are displayed correctly for each language (Portuguese, English, and Spanish). It’s a lightweight, built-in solution that eliminates the need for external libraries for common i18n tasks."
